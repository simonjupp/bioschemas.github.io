  title: Patient Registry
  subtitle: Bioschemas specification describing a patient or disease registry
  description: A patient registry is an organised system that uses observational study
    methods to collect uniform data (clinical and other) to evaluate specified outcomes
    for a population defined by a particular disease, condition, or exposure, and
    serves one or more predetermined scientific, clinical, or policy purposes.

    designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. http://schema.org/width,
    http://schema.org/color, http://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect
    such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic
    property/value mechanism.'

  description: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific
    types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between
    something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use
    the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org
    tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined
    externally.
