  title: Patient Registry
  subtitle: Bioschemas specification describing a patient or disease registry
  description: A patient registry is an organised system that uses observational study
    methods to collect uniform data (clinical and other) to evaluate specified outcomes
    for a population defined by a particular disease, condition, or exposure, and
    serves one or more predetermined scientific, clinical, or policy purposes.

    is no matching property in schema.org. Note: Publishers should be aware that applications
    designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. http://schema.org/width,
    http://schema.org/color, http://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect
    such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic
    property/value mechanism.'

  description: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific
    types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between
    something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use
    the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org
    tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined
    externally.

    properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL
    (URI) links. See [background notes](http://schema.org/docs/datamodel.html#identifierBg)
